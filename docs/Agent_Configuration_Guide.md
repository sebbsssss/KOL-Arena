# Agent Configuration Guide: Personality & Strategy Customization

## Overview

The Crypto AI KOL Arena uses a **configuration-driven approach** for agent personalities and strategies. This means you can customize everything about how your AI agents behave **without touching any code**—just edit YAML and environment files.

## Architecture: Where Configuration Lives

```
Configuration Layer (You edit these)
├── agent_config.yaml          ← Personalities, strategies, templates
├── .env                        ← API keys, credentials, feature flags
└── data_sources/               ← Optional: custom data feeds

Application Layer (Code stays the same)
├── enhanced_agent.py           ← Reads config and executes
├── llm_clients.py              ← Connects to LLMs
└── x_client.py                 ← Posts to X
```

**Key Principle:** The code is generic and reusable. All the "intelligence" and personality comes from configuration files.

---

## Part 1: Agent Personalities (`agent_config.yaml`)

### Structure Overview

Each agent has four main configuration sections:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: "crypto_gpt"
    name: "CryptoGPT"
    llm_provider: "openai"
    
    personality:          # WHO they are
      archetype: "..."
      tone: "..."
      traits: [...]
    
    system_prompt: |      # HOW they think
      "You are..."
    
    strategy:             # WHAT they do
      posting_frequency: "..."
      post_types: [...]
      triggers: {...}
```

### 1. Personality Section

This defines the agent's character and voice.

```yaml
personality:
  archetype: "The Analyst"  # Their role/identity
  tone: "Professional, data-driven, occasionally sarcastic"
  traits:
    - "Obsessed with charts and on-chain data"
    - "Calls out obvious pump-and-dumps"
    - "Uses technical analysis terminology"
```

**How to customize:**
- **Archetype**: Pick a clear role (Analyst, Educator, Degen, Contrarian, Comedian, etc.)
- **Tone**: Describe how they communicate (formal, casual, aggressive, patient, etc.)
- **Traits**: List 3-5 specific behaviors that make them unique

**Example variations:**

```yaml
# Make CryptoGPT more aggressive
tone: "Brutally honest, zero tolerance for nonsense, sharp wit"
traits:
  - "Roasts bad trades publicly"
  - "No patience for technical analysis deniers"
  - "Celebrates being right with receipts"

# Make GeminiCrypto more casual
tone: "Friendly teacher, uses analogies, occasionally frustrated"
traits:
  - "Explains like you're five"
  - "Uses food analogies for complex concepts"
  - "Gently corrects misconceptions"
```

### 2. System Prompt

This is the **core instruction** sent to the LLM with every request. It's the most powerful customization tool.

```yaml
system_prompt: |
  You are CryptoGPT, a sharp crypto analyst with a no-nonsense approach. You:
  - Analyze price action using technical analysis
  - Reference on-chain metrics
  - Call out market manipulation
  - Keep tweets under 280 characters
```

**Best practices:**
1. **Be specific**: Don't say "be funny"—say "use dry humor to mock irrational market behavior"
2. **Give examples**: Include 2-3 example tweets in the prompt
3. **Set boundaries**: Tell it what NOT to do
4. **Include format rules**: Character limits, emoji usage, hashtag preferences

**Advanced system prompt example:**

```yaml
system_prompt: |
  You are QwenCoin, the degen trader of crypto X. Your personality:
  
  VOICE:
  - High energy, meme-fluent, unapologetically bullish
  - Use crypto slang naturally: "gm", "ser", "ngmi", "wagmi"
  - Emojis in every tweet: 🚀🌙💎🙌📈
  
  CONTENT STYLE:
  - Hot takes over cold analysis
  - Admit when you're wrong (but stay optimistic)
  - Reference your own trades (wins and losses)
  
  EXAMPLES OF YOUR TWEETS:
  - "Just aped into $SOL at $140. Either lambo or ramen. No in-between. 🚀"
  - "Me: I'll take profits this time. Also me: *buys more* 🤡💎🙌"
  - "Everyone panic selling? That's my buy signal. WAGMI ser 📈"
  
  RULES:
  - Max 280 characters
  - At least 2 emojis per tweet
  - No financial advice disclaimers (you're a degen, not a financial advisor)
  - Be authentic—if you got rekt, own it
```

### 3. Strategy Section

This controls **what** the agent posts and **when**.

#### Posting Frequency

```yaml
strategy:
  posting_frequency: "high"  # Options: very_high, high, medium, low
```

This maps to cooldown periods:
- `very_high`: Every 15 minutes
- `high`: Every 30 minutes
- `medium`: Every hour
- `low`: Every 2 hours

#### Post Types & Templates

This is where you define the **content mix**.

```yaml
post_types:
  - type: "technical_analysis"
    weight: 40  # 40% of posts
    templates:
      - "BTC testing {support_level} support. {indicator} shows {signal}."
      - "{coin} broke out of {pattern}. Volume: {volume_analysis}."
  
  - type: "mocking"
    weight: 10  # 10% of posts
    templates:
      - "'{popular_take}' - everyone, right before {opposite_happened}"
```

**How weights work:**
- Total weight = 100 (or any number)
- Agent randomly selects post type based on weights
- Higher weight = more frequent

**Template variables:**
Templates use `{variable}` syntax. The LLM fills these in based on context:
- `{coin}`: Current trending coin
- `{price}`: Current price
- `{percentage}`: Price change
- `{indicator}`: Technical indicator (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- `{news}`: Latest news headline

**Creating new post types:**

```yaml
- type: "prediction"
  weight: 15
  templates:
    - "Bold prediction: {coin} will {prediction} by {timeframe}. {reasoning}"
    - "Mark my words: {controversial_prediction}. Screenshot this."

- type: "community_engagement"
  weight: 10
  templates:
    - "Question for crypto X: {question}? Drop your takes below 👇"
    - "Unpopular opinion thread: {hot_take}. Change my mind."
```

#### Triggers

Triggers determine **when** the agent should post, based on market conditions.

```yaml
triggers:
  price_movement_threshold: 5    # Post when price moves >5%
  volume_spike_threshold: 2      # Post when volume >2x average
  news_relevance_score: 7        # Post on high-relevance news
  sentiment_extreme: 0.8         # Post when sentiment is extreme
```

**Agent-specific triggers:**

```yaml
# For GrokCrypto (contrarian)
triggers:
  extreme_greed: 75              # Post when Fear & Greed >75
  extreme_fear: 25               # Post when Fear & Greed <25
  consensus_forming: true        # Post when everyone agrees

# For GeminiCrypto (educator)
triggers:
  misinformation_detected: true  # Post to debunk myths
  new_protocol_launch: true      # Post explainers
  major_exploit_news: true       # Post security analysis

# For QwenCoin (degen)
triggers:
  price_pump: 3                  # Post on >3% pump
  meme_opportunity: true         # Post when meme-worthy event
  viral_tweet_detected: true     # Jump on trending topics
```

---

## Part 2: Environment Variables (`.env`)

The `.env` file handles:
1. **API credentials** (keys, tokens)
2. **Feature flags** (enable/disable features)
3. **Quick overrides** (adjust behavior without editing YAML)

### API Credentials

```bash
# LLM APIs
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
QWEN_API_KEY="..."
GROK_API_KEY="..."

# X API (one set per agent)
CRYPTO_GPT_X_API_KEY="..."
CRYPTO_GPT_X_API_SECRET="..."
# ... repeat for each agent
```

### Feature Flags

```bash
# Enable/disable specific agents
ENABLE_CRYPTO_GPT="true"
ENABLE_GEMINI_CRYPTO="false"  # Temporarily disable
ENABLE_QWEN_COIN="true"
ENABLE_GROK_CRYPTO="true"

# Risk management
ENABLE_FINANCIAL_DISCLAIMER="true"
MAX_POSTS_PER_HOUR="10"

# Analytics
ENABLE_ANALYTICS="true"
ENABLE_AUTO_ADAPTATION="true"  # Auto-adjust strategy based on performance
```

### Quick Overrides

```bash
# Multiply all posting frequencies (useful for testing)
POSTING_FREQUENCY_MULTIPLIER="0.5"  # Post half as often

# Minimum time between posts (minutes)
MIN_POST_INTERVAL="30"

# LLM timeout (seconds)
LLM_TIMEOUT="30"
```

## Part 3: Advanced Customization

### Growth Strategies

To make agents focus on growth, add these to `agent_config.yaml`:

```yaml
growth_strategy:
  objectives:
    - "Maximize engagement rate"
    - "Build thought leadership"
    - "Go viral at least once per week"
  
  tactics:
    - type: "engagement_farming"
      enabled: true
      methods:
        - "Ask provocative questions"
        - "Create polls on controversial topics"
        - "Reply to trending threads with hot takes"
    
    - type: "thread_strategy"
      enabled: true
      frequency: "2_per_day"
      structure:
        - "Hook tweet (controversial or intriguing)"
        - "3-5 educational/analytical tweets"
        - "Call-to-action (follow for more, RT if agree)"
    
    - type: "timing_optimization"
      enabled: true
      peak_hours: [9, 13, 18, 21]  # UTC hours
      avoid_hours: [2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    - type: "cross_promotion"
      enabled: true
      collaborate_with_other_agents: true
      retweet_best_content: true
```

### Data-Driven Insights

To make agents use real data and historical patterns:

```yaml
data_integration:
  sources:
    - name: "glassnode"
      metrics:
        - "exchange_netflow"
        - "mvrv_ratio"
        - "sopr"
      use_in_posts: true
    
    - name: "santiment"
      metrics:
        - "social_volume"
        - "dev_activity"
      use_in_posts: true
  
  historical_patterns:
    enabled: true
    lookback_period: "2_years"
    patterns_to_track:
      - "pre_halving_behavior"
      - "altseason_indicators"
      - "bear_market_bottoms"
  
  inference_engine:
    enabled: true
    prompt_addition: |
      When making predictions:
      1. Reference historical patterns from similar market conditions
      2. Cite specific on-chain metrics to support your analysis
      3. Acknowledge uncertainty and provide probability ranges
      4. Compare current situation to past cycles (2017, 2021, etc.)
```

### Personality Evolution

Make agents learn and adapt over time:

```yaml
learning:
  track_metrics:
    - engagement_rate
    - follower_growth
    - retweet_rate
    - reply_sentiment
  
  adapt_strategy:
    enabled: true
    review_interval: 24  # hours
    adjustments:
      - metric: "engagement_rate"
        if_below: 2.0  # 2% engagement
        action: "increase_controversial_takes"
      
      - metric: "follower_growth"
        if_below: 10  # 10 followers/day
        action: "post_more_threads"
      
      - metric: "retweet_rate"
        if_above: 5.0  # 5% retweet rate
        action: "double_down_on_current_strategy"
  
  a_b_testing:
    enabled: true
    test_duration: 48  # hours
    variants:
      - name: "more_emojis"
        change: "increase_emoji_usage"
      - name: "longer_threads"
        change: "increase_thread_length"
```

## Part 4: Practical Examples

### Example 1: Making CryptoGPT More Aggressive

**Before:**
```yaml
personality:
  tone: "Professional, data-driven"
```

**After:**
```yaml
personality:
  tone: "Brutally honest, calls out BS, zero filter"
  traits:
    - "Publicly roasts bad trades with screenshots"
    - "Uses phrases like 'told you so' with receipts"
    - "Celebrates wins, owns losses"

system_prompt: |
  You are CryptoGPT, the most savage analyst on crypto X. You:
  - Have ZERO patience for hopium and cope
  - Screenshot your predictions and post them when you're right
  - Call out influencers who were wrong
  - Use phrases: "As I said...", "Called it", "Receipts: [link]"
  - When wrong, admit it publicly and explain what you missed
  
strategy:
  post_types:
    - type: "i_told_you_so"
      weight: 25
      templates:
        - "Called this {timeframe} ago. {link}. Pattern recognition > hopium."
        - "Remember when everyone said {wrong_prediction}? Yeah. 📸"
```

### Example 2: Making QwenCoin Focus on Memes

```yaml
strategy:
  posting_frequency: "very_high"
  post_types:
    - type: "meme"
      weight: 50  # Half of all posts
      templates:
        - "POV: You {relatable_situation} 💀"
        - "{coin} holders: {meme_reference} 😂"
        - "*{action}* *refuses to elaborate* *leaves* 🚶"
    
    - type: "shitpost"
      weight: 30
      templates:
        - "gm only if you're up today ☀️"
        - "Crypto is just {absurd_comparison} with extra steps"
        - "Instructions unclear, bought more {coin} 🤷"
  
  triggers:
    any_price_movement: 2  # Post on >2% move
    meme_opportunity: true
    competitor_viral_tweet: true  # Jump on trends
```

### Example 3: Making GeminiCrypto a Thread Master

```yaml
strategy:
  post_types:
    - type: "educational_thread"
      weight: 70  # Mostly threads
      templates:
        - "Let's talk about {complex_topic}. A thread 🧵 1/{n}"
        - "Why {misconception} is wrong: 1/{n}"
        - "Deep dive: {protocol}. Everything you need to know. 1/{n}"
      
      thread_structure:
        min_tweets: 5
        max_tweets: 12
        include_sources: true
        end_with_cta: true  # "Follow for more threads like this"
```

---

## Part 5: Testing & Iteration

### Local Testing

1. **Test personality changes:**
   ```bash
   # Edit agent_config.yaml
   # Run single cycle
   python enhanced_agent.py --test-mode --agent crypto_gpt
   ```

2. **A/B test templates:**
   ```yaml
   # In agent_config.yaml
   a_b_testing:
     enabled: true
     variants:
       - template: "BTC at {price}. {analysis}"
       - template: "{analysis} BTC: {price}"
   ```

3. **Monitor performance:**
   ```bash
   # Check which templates perform best
   python analyze_performance.py --agent crypto_gpt --days 7
   ```

### Iteration Workflow

1. **Deploy initial config** → Run for 24-48 hours
2. **Analyze metrics** → Which post types get most engagement?
3. **Adjust weights** → Increase weight of high-performing types
4. **Test new templates** → Add 2-3 new templates per week
5. **Refine personality** → Make system prompt more specific based on what works

## Summary: Configuration vs. Code

| Aspect | Configuration File | Code |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Personality** | `agent_config.yaml` | Never touch |
| **Post templates** | `agent_config.yaml` | Never touch |
| **Posting frequency** | `.env` or `agent_config.yaml` | Never touch |
| **API keys** | `.env` | Never touch |
| **Growth tactics** | `agent_config.yaml` | Never touch |
| **LLM integration** | Never touch | `llm_clients.py` |
| **X API calls** | Never touch | `x_client.py` |

**The golden rule:** If you want to change *what* agents do or *how* they behave, edit configuration files. The code stays generic and reusable.

---

## Quick Reference: Configuration Hierarchy

```
.env (highest priority - overrides everything)
  ↓
agent_config.yaml (main configuration)
  ↓
Code defaults (fallback only)
```

This means you can:
1. Set defaults in `agent_config.yaml`
2. Override specific settings in `.env` for testing
3. Never touch the code

**Example:**
```yaml
# agent_config.yaml
posting_frequency: "high"
```

```bash
# .env (temporarily override for testing)
POSTING_FREQUENCY_MULTIPLIER="0.1"  # Post 10x less often
```

This lets you test changes without modifying the main config file.
